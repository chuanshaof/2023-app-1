This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 1.Install

### npm
```
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```

## 2.Start
Run on node version 16.16.0

```sh
npm start
```

## 3.Build

```sh
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

Your app is ready to be deployed.

## User Guide
You can find detailed instructions on using Create React App and many tips in [its documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/).

# File Structure & Comments
Rather than covering all the files that are present, I will be commenting either in file directories or individual files to explain their purpose.

I will only be focusing on the files in `/src` as the rest are trivial.

## Code that contributed to the final product
These are the crucial edits made to configure the template to our desired outcome.
```    
+ layouts/dashboard/navbar
    Used to configure the sidebar to tabs we needed  

+ pages/
    + Funds.js
        Home page for /funds, which renders a table
    + FundsBreakdown.js
        Page for `Analytics`, which renders a dashboard
    + FundsInstrumentBreakdown.js
        Page for `Analytics`, which renders a dashboard
    + Instruments.js
        Route to /instruments, which renders a table
        Also handles the injestor API call
    + dashboard/Chat.js
        Used for creating chat sidebar on the right

+ routes/
    Used for SPA purposes and routing to the various tabs
    
+ sections/@dashboard/
    + chat/
        Used for Chat API connecting to backend using axios
        Also used to attempt to try to store cache for chat histories
    + general/analytics/
        Query 1 to 5 was used for the /app queries to the backend
```


Below are directories and code crucial to the UI of the frontend, but were mostly code that was generated by the template.
```
+ components/
+ theme/
+ utils/
+ App.js
+ config.js
+ index.js
```

## Issues with the template
Most of the code was edited from a template that was deprecated and faces issues when running and building.

There are many redundancies that are not used in the final MVP that was not removed when submitting the final product. They are listed as follows.

```
+ _mock/
    This is used to initialize fake data for the original template
+ assets/
    Most of these files were not used except for `gic-logo.png`
+ contexts/
    These contexts are for OAuth or services such as AWSCognito and Firebase
    In our implementation, these contexts were not implemented or used
+ guards/
    For OAuth purposes to redirect users, but not used in this case
+ hooks/
    Mostly hooks for unused or not intended functionalities
    Example is `useCollapseDrawer` for the sidebar, but it is not intended
+ locales/
    Translations, but unused
+ redux/
    Local storage for users
    This was meant to store chat history, but scrapped due to a lack of time
+ sections/
    Template files that were never used
    Exception of /@dashboard/general/analytics/
+ reportWebVitals.js
+ service-worker.js
+ serviceWorkerRegistration.js
```
